## Project Description

Dental Flow is an advanced dental practice management solution designed specifically for dental professionals in rural or remote areas where access to such systems is limited or prohibitively expensive. This comprehensive platform streamlines various aspects of dental practice management, making it easier for dentists to manage patient treatment plans, inventory, and communication smoothly.

### Key Features

- **Patient Management:** Register new patients, search for existing patients, and manage detailed treatment plans, including dental chart assessments, treatment procedures, cost summaries, scheduling, and PDF generation.  
- **Inventory Management:** Add, remove, and modify inventory items with alerts for low stock and expiring items.  
- **Direct Messaging:** Secure communication for appointment reminders, treatment discussions, and follow-ups.
